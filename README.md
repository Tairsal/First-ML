## Machine Learning Model for Water-Soluble Materials  

This project involves the development of a machine learning model based on a dataset of water-soluble materials. The objective is to predict certain properties of these materials using different regression techniques.  

## **Project Overview**  
The dataset consists of various features describing the characteristics of water-soluble materials. We implemented and compared two machine learning models:  

1. **Linear Regression**  
2. **Random Forest Regression**  

## **Performance Comparison**  
The models were evaluated using **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **RÂ² score** on both the training and test sets. The results indicate that:  

- The **Linear Regression** model performed better on the test data, achieving a lower MSE (1.02) and a higher RÂ² score (0.789).  
- The **Random Forest** model had a slightly better fit on the training data but showed overfitting, as indicated by the higher test MSE (1.407) and lower test RÂ² score (0.709).  

## **Technologies Used**  
- Python  
- Scikit-learn (for model implementation)  
- Pandas & NumPy (for data processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)  

3. The model will train and evaluate based on the dataset.
